<h1>Simpson family</h1>
<img src="img.png">
<p>
    The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company.The series is
    a satirical depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart,
    Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture and society,
    television, and the human condition.
    The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer
    James L. Brooks. He created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members,
    substituting Bart for his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded similar to "simpleton".
